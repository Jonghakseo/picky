# bash-async

Bounded background shell jobs for finite, non-interactive commands in [pi](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi).

## Install

```bash
pi install npm:@ryan_nookpi/pi-extension-bash-async
```

Do not load this package alongside another extension that registers `bash_async`.

## Tool interface

The extension registers the `bash_async` tool with five actions:

- `start`: launch a finite command in the background
- `status`: inspect one job
- `output`: read retained job output
- `kill`: stop a queued or running job
- `list`: list retained jobs

Use `start` when the next action does not need the command result immediately. Completion or failure arrives automatically through a follow-up message, so do not poll `status`, `output`, or `list`, and do not run sleep loops while waiting. Query output only when an early result is useful or the user asks for it. A repeated `status`, `output`, or `list` query that would return the same information as the previous one fails with a rate-limit error until the job state changes or the cooldown expires.

TUI programs, REPLs, commands requiring stdin, and selection menus are unsupported.

## Limits and retention

- Commands time out after 1,800 seconds by default. Set `timeout` to `0` to disable the timeout.
- Up to four jobs run concurrently by default. Set `PI_BASH_ASYNC_MAX_CONCURRENCY` to a positive integer to change the limit.
- The poll cooldown is 10 seconds. Set `PI_BASH_ASYNC_POLL_COOLDOWN_MS` to another value, or to `0` to disable rate limiting.
- The extension retains at most 20 active or queued jobs.
- Closed logs are stored under the operating system's temporary directory, normally in `pi-bash-async`, and retained for up to 24 hours.
- Closed logs share a 1 GiB quota. Older closed logs may be pruned before 24 hours when the quota is exceeded.
- Pi session shutdown aborts active jobs, settles them, and clears the running-jobs widget. Jobs do not continue across Pi shutdown.
